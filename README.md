# Container Yard Slot Picker API

This Spring Boot API receives container data and recommends the **best available yard slot** based on various scoring rules like distance, size fit, cold storage, and occupancy.

---

## Problem Statement

Imagine a busy shipping yard. A robot crane must place containers **quickly and optimally** on available slots. Each slot has constraints such as:

- Size capacity (small/big)
- Cold storage availability
- Occupancy status

Your job is to **compute a score for each slot** and return the **best one** for the container.
